{"x": 6,"y": 7,"points": [[12, 17], [24, 21], [35, 16], [39, 8], [45, 13], [41, 25], [23, 29]]}
/*
Given the image above, the JSON describes the line shown: it starts at x = 6 and y = 7, then the virtual pen moves to x = 12 and y = 17 and through each of the other points until it reaches the last point (x = 23 and y = 29), these points are the red shaded points on the image. After the last coordinate the virtual pen is put down and the virtual line is stroked with a pen that's 2 units wide.
I'm trying to capture any interactions in the shaded pen area of the line. So, for instance, if the point where x = 6 and y = 5 was chosen the chosen action wouldn't be triggered. If, on the other hand, the point where x = 9 and y = 11 was chosen the action would be triggered.
